I made 3 changes only.
To begin with, in your app.js, inside the forEach loop and in the if condition you used turn as a bool var and if the condition turns out to be true, then you were suppossed to set its value to 'O' and locally the value of turn should be true but instead of that uou used document.getElemenet and all which made its value change permanently and as a result on the browser, the 'X' was not visible as I sent it to you in the first video.

In addition to this, I felt that the color of 'X' and 'O' was kind of similar to the background color of the boxes. As a remedy, I changed it to black and also set the font weight to bolder so that it becomes catchy for the user. This is not more imp than logic you used in app.js but in ui this seems to be a very critical part.

Rest all of the game, logic, functionality and code is awesome. I am proud of you!! ❤️
